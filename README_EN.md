# 🏢 Datacenter PrimeOps  
**Hybrid Infrastructure & Automation Engineering**

Datacenter PrimeOps is a complete, modular environment designed for enterprise-grade infrastructure automation, security operations, and hybrid datacenter architecture.  
It serves as both a **professional laboratory** and a **production-ready reference model** for cloud, network, and cybersecurity engineering.

---

## 🚀 Overview
PrimeOps integrates multiple domains — network engineering, system administration, cloud automation, and security operations — into one cohesive framework.  
It is structured for **continuous learning**, **certification practice**, and **infrastructure reliability testing**.

**Key objectives:**
- Design and simulate a modern datacenter with hybrid cloud integration.  
- Implement CI/CD pipelines, IaC automation, and Zero Trust principles.  
- Test real-world scenarios for security, resilience, and scalability.

## 🧩 Core Architecture

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Infrastructure** | Virtualized topology built with EVE-NG, integrating Fortinet, Cisco, and Linux environments. |
| **Networking** | Routing, VLAN segmentation, VPN tunnels, and perimeter firewalls. |
| **Active Directory** | Centralized authentication and group policies for corporate environments. |
| **Linux Servers** | LPIC-based systems for file, web, and automation services. |
| **Data Services** | Internal cloud storage similar to Google Drive for private deployment. |
| **Security** | Fortinet Labs, SOC simulations, SIEM integration, and Zero Trust enforcement. |
| **Automation** | Infrastructure as Code using Ansible, Terraform, and GitHub Actions. |

---

## ⚙️ Automation & Scripts
The repository includes a complete set of automation scripts and configuration templates:

- **Network Deployment** → Automated creation of topologies via EVE-NG.  
- **Security Policies** → Fortinet firewall configuration and validation routines.  
- **Linux Automation** → Bash and Ansible scripts for server hardening and service deployment.  
- **Monitoring Stack** → Prometheus + Grafana integration with alerting and log forwarding.  
- **CI/CD** → GitHub Actions for infrastructure testing and deployment validation.  

---

## 🔐 Security & SOC Labs
PrimeOps provides a dedicated **SOC (Security Operations Center) simulation environment**:

- Fortinet Firewall and VPN Lab  
- SIEM deployment with log analysis and correlation  
- Incident detection and response workflows  
- Zero Trust access model for multi-cloud resources  

---

## ☁️ Cloud Integration
Hybrid environment designed for practical certification and enterprise implementation:

- **Google Cloud Platform** — automation and identity management labs  
- **AWS** — hybrid network and security scenarios  
- **Azure** — CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure governance
